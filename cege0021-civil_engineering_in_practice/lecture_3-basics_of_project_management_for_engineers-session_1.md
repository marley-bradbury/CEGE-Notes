# CEGE0021 - Basics of project management for engineers - Session 1

## What are projects - some examples
- UCL Integrated Design Project
- Feasibility study of river works to relieve flooding
- Designing a new river crossing
- Constructing a new river crossing
- Developing and implementing a new underground railway line

## Example images (image pending)

## What are projects - key characteristics
- Purpose - defined product or result
- Transient - usually have start and finish dates
- Unfamiliar - undertaken in an environment of risk and uncertainty
- Lifecycle - will often have sequential phases
- Multidisciplinary – project teams often need to include people with lots of different skills

## What are projects - definitions
### Association of Project Management (APM)
A project is a unique, transient endeavour, undertaken to achieve planned objectives, which could be defined in terms of outputs, outcomes or benefits.

### Project Management Institute (PMI)
A project is a temporary endeavour undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result.

## Lifecycle of civil engineering  projects

## Project phases
[Gant chart]()

Gates are used to:
- Check that the project is still required and is viable
- Conﬁrm that the risks are acceptable
- Conﬁrm the project’s priority relative to other projects
- Approve the plan for the remainder of the project
- Conﬁrm that there are adequate resources to complete the project
- Make a go or no-go decision to continue the project

## Project phases - example

## Organisations that manage projects
- Client organisations
    - Public sector client organisations
        
        eg TfL, Network Rail, Crossrail Environment Agency- Will be involved in all phases of projects for which they are the client.  May be supported by project management organisations.
    - Private sector client organisations

        eg BP, BAA, National Grid - Will be involved in all phases of projects for which they are a client. May be supported by project management organisations.

- Design consultants
    
    eg Arup, Mott MacDonald, Atkins - Involved in one or more phases relating to design or construction support.  Design consultants may change from one stage to the next.

- Contractors

    eg Balfour Beatty, Skanska, Costain, Laing O'Rourke - Involved in one or more phases relating to construction or design in a design and build context.

## What is project management
The objective is to deliver a project on time, within budget and to the required quality.

### According to BS ISO 21500 - Guidance on project management

Project management is the application of methods, tools, techniques and competencies to a project.

## Project team structure
How would you structure yourselves based on previous teamwork?
- Hierarchical structure
- Flat structure

[project team structure]()

## Project team structure - example
[Cross Harbour Rail Tunnel, Hong Kong]()

## Project team roles - project manager
- Motivates and leads the team
- Prepares project management plans
- Deﬁnes the work scope and targets for each team 
- Monitors and manages project progress, and risks and opportunities
- Manages the scope of the project and control changes
- Engages with stakeholders
- Delivers the project on time, to budget and at the agreed quality

## Project team roles - team leaders
- Directs and supervises the members of their team.
- Liaises and works with other team leaders
- Monitors and manages progress, and risks and opportunities on delegated work scope
- Monitors changes to their work scope
- Ensures delegated work scope is completed on time, to budget and at agreed quality 

## Project team roles - team members
- Accountable to the respective team leader for deliverables allocated to them, ensuring that they are completed on time, to budget and at agreed quality
- Escalates potential changes and risks to the team leader.

## Building a great project team
People who have the correct:
- Experience for the role
- Skills for the role
- Behaviours for the role

A balanced team with a good mix of behaviours.  Problems can occur when:
- Team members have similar weaknesses, so the whole team has those weaknesses.
- Team members have similar strengths and end up competing rather than cooperating with one another.

## Project team members - behaviours
According to Belbin there a nine clusters of behaviours
- Resource Investigator
- Team worker
- Coordinator
- Plant
- Monitor Evaluator
- Specialist
- Shaper
- Implementer
- Completer Finisher

## Project management processes
BS ISO 21500 structures project management process using:
- Process groups
    - Initiating processes:
    
        defining objectives and authorising the project manager to proceed
    - Planning processes:
    
        planning to establish baselines against which project implementation can be managed and project performance measured
    - Implementing processes:
    
        performing the project management activities and to supporting the provision of the project deliverables in accordance with the project plan
    - Controlling processes:
    
        monitoring, measuring and controling project performance against the project plan
    - Closing processes:
    
        formally establishing that the project or project phase is finished and providing lessons learned

- Subject groups
    - Integration:
    
        identifying, defining, combining, unifying, coordinating, controling and closing the various activities
    - Stakeholder:
    
        identifying and managing project stakeholders
    - Scope:
    
        identifying and defining the work and deliverables required
    - Resource:
    
        identifying and acquiring adequate resources such as people, facilities, equipment, materials and tools
    - Time:
    
        scheduling the project activities and monitoring progress to control the schedule
    - Cost:
    
        developing the budget and monitoring progress to control costs

## Scope management - define scope
To achieve clarity of the project scope, including objectives, deliverables, requirements and boundaries, by defining the end state of the project.  Useful to this is what is known as a Product Breakdown Structures (PBS)

### Association of Project Management (APM)
A PBS is a hierarchical structure where the main output of the project is placed at the top level. The next level down shows the components that make up the higher level. This process continues to the level of individual products. Each product will have defined acceptance criteria and quality control methods.

## Example Product Breakdown Structure (PBS)
[Example PBS]()

[Example PBS 2]()

## Scope magagement - define activities
Having defined the product in terms of a Product Breakdown Structure the next task is to determine what needs to be done to delivery that product.  Useful to this is what is known as a Work Breakdown Structures (WBS)

### Association of Project Management (APM)
A WBS is similar to a PBS but shows the work required to create the products. The lowest level of a WBS shows the activities that would be used to create a network diagram for time scheduling.

### Defining
- Defining activities entails progressively breaking down the project into activities and sub-activities of work.
- At lowest sub-activity level
    - What needs to be done can be readily understood
    - Progress and an completion can be readily determined
    - Ideally there should be a deliverable associated with the sub-activity

### Stages

    - Workshop with TfL to discuss outcomes
    - Produce final reports
    - Asbestos Management Survey & Management Plan

## Scope management- create WBS
- assign task numbers to activities (e.g the sub task "Progress meetings" is in task "Meetings and reporting" (the second task) so it is assigned 2.1)

## Time management - sequencing activities
- Finish to start
- Finish to Finish
- Start to Start
- Start to Finish

## Time management - activity durations
For a typical design project:

Requires knowledge of complexity of the design and rates of output from designers as well as client expectations
- Look at output rates for projects of similar complexity
- Talk to the people that will carry out the work or with experience
- Allow for internal and external review comments and resubmission
- Duration of approvals and consents must be agreed with client

## Time management - Activity durations
Assign predicted durations to each subtask

## Time management - Schedule
[example schedule]()

## Risk management – identify risks
For the simple example of booking a holiday, risk issues could be:
- Unable to finalise selection of destination based on research and selection criteria leading to delay in booking the holiday
- Budget is not sufficient for a holiday at your chosen destination leading to delay in booking an alternative destination that is within budget
-There are no flights from your local airport to your chosen destination leading to an additional cost for airport transfers

## Risk management - assess risks
Likelihood (1-5) vs Cosequence (1-5)
- A highly unlikey incident with non serious consequence would be L1C1 (Low priority)
- A highly unlikey incident with serious consequence would be L1C5 (Medium priority)
- A highly likely non serious consequence would be L5C1 (Medium priority)
- A highly likely serious consequence would L5C5 (High Priority)

## Project plan
- Summary of the project objectives and the means to achieve them
- Summary of the project completion criteria and how the sponsor decides whether or not the project has succeeded in achieving its objectives
- Scope
- Project breakdown structures to be used (work, cost, product, organizational, risk)
- Schedule
- Resources
- Cost
- Risks
