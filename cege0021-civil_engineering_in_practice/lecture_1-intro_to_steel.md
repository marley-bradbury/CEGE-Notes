# CEGE0021 - Introduction to steel

## Advantages of Steel
Steel is:
- strong
- stiff
- easy to fabricate
- easy to modify
- relatiely cheap

## Steel Composition
Structural steel is principally an alloy of iron, carbon and manganese.

Other elements include:
- chromium
- molybdemum
- vandium
- nickle
- copper

## Influence of Carbon Content on Properties
As the carbon content increases so the steel strength increase but the impact energy required to induce brittle fracture (known as toughness) and ductility increases.

## Control of Grain Size
Finer grain size can be achieve by:
- removal of steel from the furnace and cooling
- cooling of smaller sections
- heavy deformation of steel at tempuratures >723C

## Steel Making
The process of steel making consists of three stages:
- smelting iron ore to produce pig or cast iron
- reduction of pig iron into steel
- rolling

## Steel Making: Stage 1:
Stage 1 consists of heating iron ore, coke and limestone in a blastfurnace to release the iron.

FeO + C --------> Fe + CO

The cast iron thus produced contains a large amount of impurities which renders it weak in tension and brittle.

## Steel Making: Stage 2:
Stage 2 consists of remelting pig iron with scrap steel in a vessel termed a converter which is blown with oxygen to oxidise the impurities.

Various types of converters are used, the two most common being:
- basic oxygen furnace
- electric arc furnace

The steel is used to produce either ingots or to form continuous solid strands.

## Steel Making: Stage 3
Stage 3 involves usually hot rolling (>1000C) the ingots into plates structural steel sections, bars, etc.

If heavy deformations applied low in the temperature range the net result is very high strength but lack ductility (cold forming).

## Engineering properties of steel
When selecting steel for a particular purpose it is normal to consider the following:
- strength
- deformation
- toughness
- fatigue
- weldability
- fire
- corrosion

## Available strength grades
- S460 - 
- S355 -
- S275 -

## Deformation
The deformation (eg deflection) of a steel member is governed by young's modulus.

The value of youngs modulus (e) is about 210kN/mm2 irrespective of steel grade.

Control of deformation is achieved through selection of section geometry and deatailing connections.

## Toughness
Steel may fail by brittle fracture. This can arise due to:
- low tempuratures
- high strain rate (impact)
- geometrical discontinuities

Brittle fracture can be avoided by selecting steel with high toughness. Toughness is a function of carbon content.

The charpy test is used to determine the resistance of steel to brittle fracture.

## Fatigue
With repeated loading at a mean stress well below the strength of the material, steel may fail because of the initiation and propagation of cracks.

Factors influencing fatigue strength are:

- number of loading cycles
- mean loading stress
- microstructure
- geometry adb surface
- welding
- corrosion

## Weldability
The high temperatures and subsequent high cooling rates involved alter the behaviour of steel when welded.

Welding can give rise to various types of cracking including:

solidification (or hot) cracking,
hydrogen induced (or cold) cracking

## Fire Resistance
although incombusible the strength of steel rapidly decreases with increasing with increasing temperature,
at a temperature of about 550C steel loses approximately 40% of it's room tempurature strength

## Methods of Fire Protection
- spray applied protection
- board protection
- intumescent coating
- concrete casing

## Corrosion
Corrosion refers to the formation of ferrous oxides (rust).

Exposed steelwork can be severely affected by corrosion due to atmospheric pollutants.

Corrosion act to:
- reduce the structural strength
- reduce toughness and fatigue life
- leave the steel surface pitted
- increase susceptibility to welding defects
