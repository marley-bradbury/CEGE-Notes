# CEGE0021 - Design of Columns Continued

COLUMNS SUBJECT TO AXIAL LOADS ONLY WERE DISCUSSED IN A PREVIOUS LECTURE. WHERE A COLUMN IS ADDITIONALLY SUBJECTED TO MOMENTS THE DESIGN APPROACH IS INTERACTIVE IN CHARACTER AND IS COVERED IN CLAUSES 6.2.1 AND 6.3.3 OF EC3.

UNDER THIS SYSTEM OF LOADING TWO CHECKS ARE USUALLY NECESSARY: LOCAL CAPACITY AND OVERALL BUCKLING. THESE CHECKS ARE CONDITIONAL UPON SECTION CLASSIFICATION AND THE METHOD OF ANALYSIS/DESIGN OF THE STRUCTURE.

## METHODS OF DESIGN

SIMPLE DESIGN
- ALL JOINTS ARE ASSUMED TO BE PINNED. THE STRUCTURE IS INVARIABLY BRACED

CONTINUOUS DESIGN
- BEAMS AND COLUMNS ARE CONNECTED SUCH THAT THEY CAN RESIST FORCES AND
MOMENTS IN MEMBERS WHICH THEY
ATTACH. - Rarely used in practice, unsafe, easy to overestimate factors of safety

SEMI CONTINUOUS DESIGN
- PARTIAL CONTINUITY EXISITS BETWEENS MEMBERS

## RIGID CONSTRUCTION: PORTAL FRAME

BEAM AND COLUMN CONNECTIONS ARE ASSUMED TO BE FULLY FIXED (RIGID) AND THERE ARE NO ECCENTRICITIES IN THE PLANE OF FIXITY.

## COLUMN DESIGN: GENERAL PRINCIPLES
A STRUCTURAL MEMBER SUBJECTED TO BOTH AXIAL FORCE AND MOMENTS IS TERMED A BEAM COLUMN.

WHEN COMBINED CONDITIONS OBTAIN, STRENGTH MAY BE LINKED TO EITHER OF THE FOLLOWING:
- LOCAL CAPACITY
- OVERALL BUCKLING

IT IS NECESSARY TO ASSESS ALL POSSIBLE LOADING REGIMES SINCE SEVERAL FORCE MOMENT RELATIONSHIPS WILL EXIST. THIS IS IMPORTANT WHEN THE COLUMN FORMS PART OF A RIGID FRAME.

## COLUMN DESIGN: SIMPLE STRUCTURES
IN GENERAL, THE EFFECTIVE LENGTH OF COLUMNS IN BRACED MULTI STOREY STRUCTURES SHOULD BE TAKEN AS THE STOREY HEIGHT.

COLUMNS SHOULD BE EFFECTIVELY CONTINUOUS AT THEIR SPLICES

NOMINAL MOMENTS ARE CALCULATED USING THE FULL VALUE OF THE IMPOSED LOAD, ASSUMING THAT BEAM REACTIONS ACT 100 mm FROM THE FACE OF THE COLUMN (WEB/FLANGE).

PATTERN LOADING MAY BE IGNORED

THE NET MOMENT APPLIED AT ANY ONE LEVEL SHOULD BE DIVIDED BETWEEN THE COLUMN LENGTHS ABOVE AND BELOW THAT LEVEL IN PROPORTION TO THE STIFFNESS COEFFICIENT I/L OF EACH LENGTH, EXCEPT THAT WHEN THE RATIO OF THE STIFFNESS COEFFICIENTS DOES NOT EXCEED 1.5 THE MOMENT MAY OPTIONALLY BE DIVIDED EQUALLY.

## COLUMN DESIGN: SIMPLE STRUCTURES (CONTâ€™D)

LOCAL CAPACITY CHECK IS UNNECESSARY

MEMBER STABILITY CAN BE CHECKED USING THE FOLLOWING RELATIONSHIP

$\frac{N_{Ed}}{N_{b,z,Rd}}+\frac{M_{y,Ed}}{M_{b,Rd}}+1.5\frac{M_{z,Ed}}{M_{z,Rd}}\leq 1$

WHERE
- $M_{b,Rd} = \frac{\chi_{LT}W_yf_y}{\gamma_{M1}}$
- $M_{z,Rd} = \frac{W_{pl,z}f_y}{\gamma_{M1}}$
- $N_{b,z,Rd} = \frac{\chi _zAf_y}{\Gamma_{M1}}$

## CONTINUOUS STRUCTURES
BEAM AND COLUMN CONNECTIONS ARE ASSUMED TO BE FIXED AND THERE ARE NO ECCENTRICITIES IN THE PLANE OF FIXITY.

LOAD REGIMES WILL GIVE RISE TO SEVERAL DESIGN CASES AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT ALL POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS ARE CONSIDERED DURING MEMBER SIZING.

COLUMN MEMBERS SHOULD BE CHECKED FOR BOTH LOCAL CAPACITY AND OVERALL BUCKLING

## CONTINUOUS STRUCTURES: LOCAL CAPACITY CHECK

MAY BE VERIFIED BY MEANS OF THE FOLLOWING EXPRESSION; ENSURES THAT THE YIELD STRESS HAS NOT BEEN EXCEEDED.

$\frac{N_{Ed}}{N_{Rd}}+\frac{M_{y,Ed}}{M_{y,Rd}}+\frac{M_{z,Ed}}{M_{z,Rd}}\leq1$ - CLASSES 1 - 3 ONLY

WHERE:
- $N_{Ed}$ - AXIAL LOAD
- $M_{y,Ed}$ - APPLIED MOMENT ABOUT MAJOR AXIS
- $M_{z,Ed}$ - APPLIED MOMENT ABOUT THE MINOR AXIS
- $N_{Rd}$ - AXIAL LOAD CAPACITY OF SECTION = $\frac{Af_y}{\gamma_{M0}}$
- $M_{y,Rd}$ - MOMENT CAPACITY ABOUT MAJOR AXIS = $\frac{W_{el,y}f_y}{\gamma_{M0}}$
- $M_{z,Rd}$ - MOMENT CAPACITY ABOUT MINOR AXIS = $\frac{W_{el,z}f_y}{\gamma_{M0}}$

ALTERNATIVE EXPRESSION FOR CLASS 1 AND 2 SECTIONS

$(\frac{M_{y,Ed}}{M_{N,y,Rd}})$
