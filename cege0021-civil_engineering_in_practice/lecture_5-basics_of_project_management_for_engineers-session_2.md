# CEGE0021 - Basics of project management for engineers - Session 2

## Coursework
- Project outcomes and product breakdown structure (PBS)
- Project team structures
- Cost breakdown structures (CBS)

## Cost breakdown structures (CBS)
- Defines cost at sub-activity level in the WBS
- Determining cost requires a knowledge in:
    - Units costs. For consultancy design ser

## How do consultants make money
- They charge clients fees for their services to provide **revenue**.
- In delivering these services and in maintaining  the business they incur **costs**.
- Profit is **revenue** - **cost**
- Margin = $\frac{revenue - cost}{revenue} * 100%$
    - at a project level revenue typically 50%
    - at company level more like 25% (company overheads)

## Staff costs
- How much does it cost to employ staff. What is included:
    - Salary
    - Bank holiday
    - Annual leave
    - Paid sick leave
    - Pensions contributions
    - National insurance

- Typically **AT Cost Rates** (ACRs) are used to evaluate these. Example of hourly ACR for a senior engineer on a salary of £40,000 recieving a £4,000 car allowance:
    - Salary = $\frac{40000}{1702.5} = 23.49$
    - Paid sick leave = $23.49 * 0.02 = 0.46$

## Background to coursework
- Transport for Scotland (the Owner) has developed a schemme to provide a new bridge crossing of the Firth of Forth near to the town of Kincardine. New crossing will replace existing bridge. The form and location is driven primarily bu environmental considerations.
- Ground and environmental investigation have been undertaken by the Owner's consultants and a preliminary or coordinated design for the new bridge has been produced. The scheme has also been siccusfouly taken through RIBA stages 0-3.
- Needs to be taken through 4-6
- You are a design consultant working for one of the design build contractors and are assisting with the preparation of the tender submission.
- You will prepare parts of the technical submission and financial submission relating to the design process.

## Location plan
- Bridge is upstream
- Very long span for it's size

## Preliminary design
- Pre-stressed concrete design
- Built by incremental launching
- 3 lanes of trafic, 1 on one side 2 on the other
- Mono piles
- Special foundations

## Submission
- A description of your overall approach to managing the design of the bridge to ensure it is delivered in time, to budget and to the required quality (no more than two sides of A4)
- An organisational structure of the design team. (one side of A4)
- A description of key team roles. (No more than two sides of A4)
- A work breakdown structure in Excel that lists all of the activities and sub-activities that are required for delivery of the detailed design. Around 60 sub-activities will be sufficient.
- A description of five of the sub-activities one side of A4.
- A cost breakdown structure based on a rescoured version of the work breakdown structure in Excel to form the basis of the tender price.
- An assessment of the six key project risks that could affect the successful delivery of the design and how these risks can be eliminated or mitigated.

**Documents are to be submitted by 12:00 noon on Friday 18 November 2022**
