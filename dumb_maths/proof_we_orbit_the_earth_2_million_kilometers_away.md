# Proof we orbit the earth 2 million kilometers from it's centre
## Variables and constants
### Variables
$a$ = acceleration

$a_c$ = centripetal accelation

$F$ = force

$F_c$ = centripetal force

$F_g$ = "force" due to gravity

$r$ = radius (in this case, radius of orbit)

$v$ = velocity
### Constants
$G$ = gravitational constant = $6.67408*10^{-11}metres^3kilograms^{-1}seconds^{-2}$

$m_E$ = mass of the earth = $5.9722*10^{24}kilograms$

$r_E$ = radius of the earth = $6378140meters$

$t_{day}$ = length of 1 day = $86400seconds$
## First principles
### Centripetal force equation for simple harmonic circular motion
$a_c$ = $\frac{v^2}{r}$

$F$ = $ma$

$F_c$ = $\frac{m_ov^2}{r}$
### Newton's equation for gravitational attraction
$F_g$ = $G\frac{m_om_E}{r^2}$
## Derived equation for the velocity of an object in orbit of earth
for an orbit to be circular gravitational attraction must equal centripetal force
$\therefore F_g$ = $F_c\Rightarrow\frac{m_ov^2}{r}$ = $G\frac{m_om_E}{r^2}\Rightarrow v^2$ = $\frac{Gm_E}{r}$
## Derived velocity adjacent to the direction of the center of the earth for a person on the equator
circumference = $2\pi r$

circumference of earth = $2\pi r_E$

time for 1 full rotation of earth = $t_{day}$

angular velocity of a person on the equator = $\frac{2\pi}{t_{day}}\leftarrow$ in $radians$

velocity adjacent to the direction of the center of the earth for a person on the equator = v = $\frac{2\pi r_E}{t_{day}}\Rightarrow v^2$ = $\frac{4\pi^2r_E^2}{t_{day}^2}$
## Proof
$v^2$ = $\frac{4\pi^2r_E^2}{t_{day}^2}$

$v^2$ = $\frac{Gm_E}{r}$

$\therefore\frac{4\pi^2r_E^2}{t_{day}^2}$ = $\frac{Gm_E}{r}\Rightarrow$ r = $\frac{Gm_Et_{day}^2}{4\pi^2r_E^2}$ = $1.85*10^9meters\approx2*10^6kilometers$

$\therefore$ humans on the surface of the earth are actually orbiting the earth 2 million kilometers away
