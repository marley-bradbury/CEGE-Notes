# Proof we orbit the earth multiple times a day below it's surface
## Variables and constants
### Variables
$a$ = acceleration

$a_c$ = centripetal accelation

$F$ = force

$F_c$ = centripetal force

$F_g$ = "force" due to gravity
### Constants
$G$ = gravitational constant

$m_E$ = mass of the earth

$r_E$ = radius of the earth = 63140
## First principles
### Centripetal force equation for simple harmonic circular motion
$a_c$ = $\frac{v^2}{r}$

$F$ = $ma$

$F_c$ = $\frac{m_ov^2}{r}$
### Newton's equation for gravitational attraction
$F_g$ = $G\frac{m_om_E}{r^2}$
## Derived equation for the velocity of an object in orbit of earth
for an orbit to be circular gravitational attraction must equal centripetal force
$\therefore F_g$ = $F_c\Rightarrow\frac{m_ov^2}{r}$ = $G\frac{m_om_E}{r^2}\Rightarrow v^2$ = $\frac{Gm_E}{r}\Rightarrow v$ = $\sqrt{\frac{Gm_E}{r}}$
## Derived velocity of a person on earth adjacent to the direction of the center of the earth
