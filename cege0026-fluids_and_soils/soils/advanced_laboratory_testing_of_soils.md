## What do we measure in mechanical tests?
Two basic forms of loading
1.  compression / consolidation
    - isotropic - triaxial apparatus
    - one-dimensional (K0) - oedometer - 2nd year with pedro
2. shearing

## shearing tests
we often have conflciting requirements of our tests:
- strength - need large strains with minimum restraint while maintaining stresses & strains
- stiffness - need to apply and measure very small stress/strain changes

triaxial apparatus is faily unique in its ability to perform both functions

## direct shear test - advantages


advantages:
- mode of shearing is plane strain - similar to many engineering applications
- triaxial is axi-symmetric - NOT similar to many applications!

disadvantages:
- no control of drainage
- predetermined failure plane causes localisation of strains in centre of ample and inaccuracy of $\gamma$ and $\Epsilon_V$
- complete stress state not known so we can have any Mohr's circle so we often assume 
- uncontrolled rotation of principle stress - this will change strength measured if soil is anisotropic

## effect of mode on shearing
b = $(\sigma_2 - \sigma_3)(\sigma_1 - \sigma_3)$ - effect of b investigated in true triaxial or hollow cylinder apparatus
