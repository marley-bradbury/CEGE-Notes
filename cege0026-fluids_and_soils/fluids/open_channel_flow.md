# Open Channel Flow - Equations
## Variables
$A = Area [m^2]$

$P = Wetted Perim [m]$

$B = Surface Width [m]$

$R_h = Hydraulic Radius [m] = \frac AP$

$D_m = Hydraulic Mean Depth [m] = \frac AB$

$n = Manning Coefficient [unitless]\Rightarrow$ value that represents surface roughness

$C_h = Chezy Coefficient [unitless] = \sqrt{\frac{\rho g}k}$

 or 
$C_h = \frac{R_h^{6}}n$ (with Manning)

$Q = Flow Rate [m^3/s]$

$V = Water Velocity [m/s] = \frac QA$

 or
$V = \sqrt{\frac{\rho g}kR_hS_0} = C_h\sqrt{R_hS_0}$ (with Chezy)

 or 
$V = \frac1nR_h^{\frac 23}S_0^{\frac 12}$
